# IOC Web Checker

This project is a Python-based cybersecurity tool designed to extract and verify Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from structured and unstructured sources.

## Features
- Extracts IOCs such as IP addresses, domains, URLs, and hashes
- Verifies extracted IOCs using external threat intelligence sources
- Supports file-based IOC analysis workflows
- Designed for SOC-style incident analysis and verification

## Project Structure
- `ioc_checker.py`: Core IOC extraction logic
- `ioc_web_checker.py`: Web-based IOC verification module
- `IndicatorOfCompromises1.pdf`: Sample input document

## Notes
Generated outputs (logs, reports, result files) are intentionally excluded from version control and are created at runtime.
